In a two's complement number system, the expression `x &= (x-1)` deletes the rightmost 1 bit in `x`. 

To understand why this works, let's consider the binary representation of `x` and `x-1`. 

When subtracting 1 from `x`, the following scenarios can occur:

1. If the rightmost bit of `x` is 0, subtracting 1 will cause a borrow operation, which propagates towards the leftmost bit until it finds a 1 to borrow from. In this case, the rightmost 1 bit of `x` remains unchanged after the subtraction.

2. If the rightmost bit of `x` is 1, subtracting 1 will result in the rightmost bit becoming 0, and all the bits to the right of it (including the trailing zeros) will become 1 due to the borrow operation. In this case, the rightmost 1 bit of `x` is flipped to 0, and all the bits to the right of it become 1.

When performing the bitwise AND operation `x &= (x-1)`, the bits in `x` and `(x-1)` are compared at each position. Since `(x-1)` has a 1 at every position to the right of the rightmost 1 bit in `x`, the bitwise AND operation will result in all those bits becoming 0 in `x`. However, the rightmost 1 bit itself will remain unchanged because `(x-1)` has a 0 at that position. Therefore, the rightmost 1 bit in `x` is effectively deleted or cleared.

By repeatedly applying this operation, `x` will keep losing its rightmost 1 bit until there are no more 1 bits left, effectively removing all the trailing 1s (and the corresponding zeros) in `x`.

This property can be used in various scenarios, such as counting the number of 1 bits in a number or determining if a number is a power of 2.
